### our approach & evaluation

**Starting point:** We agreed to start at 9am with our planning and one MVP completed.  
**Check-ins:** We agreed to have group check-ins every 15 minutes.  
**5-min rule:** We set a rule that anyone stuck on something for more than 5 mins should bring the whole team onboard to help with problem solving.

## Brainstorming

As a team we brainstormed various ideas and discussed each one to gauge how feasible it would be to implement them within the given timeframe. Our discussions also considered the adaptability of the idea, in order to plan for clear MVPs and tests.

## Planning

Planning for me started with a group discussion. I wanted to use the problem to deepen my knowledge of an area I want to get better at. So for this I chose regex. I keep coming across it more and more on my coding journey and I have realised its a vital skill to learn.

I began figuring out what I wanted to achieve with it. I wanted it to be challenging enough that I would have to learn how to solve it myself. So I settled on this mvp as my problem.

If i had more time I would have liked to develop a range of tests to gradually build the skill level up with each new challenge getting sequentially harder.

The tests themselves were quite simple as I just had to put in a url and pop out the expected result.

## The problem

You are tasked to learn how to use regular expressions at your new job.
Your boss has devised a test to help you understand these cryptic codes.

You have to write a function that uses regex to extract the domain names from your customers website address. Once you master this skill you will be a regex ninja empowered with a powerful new skill set.

Learning regex is an important tool in many areas of modern coding and can be used across many languages. think of it aas a universal tool to match patterns in strings.

## The rules

Assume that only valid URLs will be passed in as strings. Your solution should return the domain portion only as a string with all other text excluded.

A few examples:

- 'https://www.google.com' should return only 'google'
- 'http://my-blog.xyz' should return only 'my-blog'
- 'https://amazon.co.uk' should return only 'amazon'
- 'https://nasa.com/elons-fan-club' should return only 'nasa'

**Good luck and happy coding**
